ipaddr.py is a library for working with IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6.
It was developed by Google for internal use, and is now open source.

This is a fork of the ipaddr project purely for the purposes of providing a
version compatible with python 3.2; in python 2.7 the original works fine,
while python 3.3 and above include a version of ipaddr called ipaddress.
Unfortunately python 3.2 is still quite a prevalent version - it's included
in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and in Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi.
